# rookmeo-and-juliet
Rookmeo and juliet materialized into a python app.

## Explanation
Two rooks from each side are randomly chosen at the start of the game. These rooks must see each other to escape from the board. However, the two rooks are unknown to the player. If they accidentally take one of the rooks, the other one will switch sides and become a queen.

## Differences
To win the game, rookmeo and juliet must look at each other, which is different from the actual one, where they escaped from the back rank.
Also, when rookmeo or juliet are taken, the other rook still turns into a queen, but it doesn't go to the other side.
